I started the project with **react-report** as the name, but the npm package name had already got reserved. I was looking for a simple global NPM package name; I tested a dozen other related names without any luck, then looked for the history of the report, paper, and printing to find a proper name. Again, all of them already have a package in npm. Eventually, I got some help from my cat. I put him over the keyboard to find a free global package name, but that one is also already occupied ðŸ˜…

In the history of printing I faced the "Jikji" book, according to [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jikji) _it is the world's oldest extant book printed with movable metal type._ it is a Korean Buddhist document and it _can be translated to **Anthology of Great Buddhist Priests' Zen Teachings**_.

I liked the name and the relation of it to the printing and finally, it was free to take as a global package name ðŸ¤©.
