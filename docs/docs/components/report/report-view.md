# Report View

This component is meant to be used in CSR only and will provide some default CSS style so that the output will be like the Chrome Print preview style screen.

```jsx
import { ReportView, ReportRoot } from "@jikji/react";

<ReportView>
  <ReportRoot>...</ReportRoot>
</ReportView>;
```

For custom styles, please check [Styling](../../styling).
